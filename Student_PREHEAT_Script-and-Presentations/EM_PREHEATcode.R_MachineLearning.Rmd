## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(randomForest)
library(janitor)
library(xgboost)
```



```{r}
data_proteomics <- read.csv("/cloud/project/3. Data Analysis/Data/Processed_Proteomics_Data.csv")
data_demo <- read.csv("/cloud/project/3. Data Analysis/Data/Demographic_Data.csv")
```


```{r}
data_tidy <-
  data_proteomics %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=!Gene_Name, names_to="Sample", values_to="Value") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=Gene_Name, values_from=Value) 
```
