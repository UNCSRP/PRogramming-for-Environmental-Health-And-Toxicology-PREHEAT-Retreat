# Group Assignments:

## Group 1: Neutrophil response-associated proteins 

*Statistics questions:*

* Provided script: At baseline (pre-exposure): What proteins are differentially expressed in PMN responders vs. non-responders?
* Script that you need to generate: Post-exposure: What proteins are differentially expressed in PMN responders vs. non-responders?
* Compare these two findings: are they the same?

*Machine learning questions:*
* Script that you need to generate: can we predict responder vs. non-responder status using protein signatures? what proteins predict responder vs. non-responder status?


## Group 2: Sex-associated proteins

*Statistics questions:*

* Provided script: At baseline (pre-exposure): What proteins differ by sex?
* Script that you need to generate: Post-exposure: What proteins differ by sex?
* Compare these two findings: are they the same?

*Machine learning questions:*
* Script that you need to generate: can we predict sex using protein signatures? what proteins predict sex?
							
## Group 3: Race/ethnicity-associated proteins

*Statistics questions:*

* Provided script: At baseline (pre-exposure): What proteins differ by race?
* Script that you need to generate: Post-exposure: What proteins differ by race?
* Compare these two findings: are they the same?


*Machine learning questions:*
* Script that you need to generate: can we predict ethnicity using protein signatures? what proteins predict ethnicity (binary variable)?
	
	
## Group 4: BMI-associated differences

*Statistics questions:*

* Provided script: At baseline (pre-exposure): What proteins differ by BMI?
* Post-exposure: What proteins differ by BMI?
* Compare these two findings: are they the same?


*Machine learning questions:*
* Script that you need to generate: can we predict BMI using protein signatures? what proteins predict BMI?

						
## Group 5: Asthma-associated proteins

*Statistics questions:*

* Provided script: At baseline (pre-exposure): What proteins differ by asthma status?
* Post-exposure: What proteins differ by asthma status?
* Compare these two findings: are they the same?


*Machine learning questions:*
* Script that you need to generate: can we predict asthma using protein signatures? what proteins predict asthma?


## Final Group Products
* 1. Each individual uploads their script to github
* 2. Each group drafts a powerpoint to present what they found, and what are the biological/clinical implications
